        <p >Hey I am Mohammed Nooh and I am a coding newbie and this is my first
            blog on why i started coding so please bear with me.
        </p>
        <p>
            It all started a few months back while i was surfing on instagram while i came across an interesting reel where a person was speaking about the level of knowledge the current college students have in India.
             His name was Tanay Pratap and when i went to his page what stood out to me was his bio which read<br>

             <em>Being the mentor i wish i had</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            From there i went to his youtube channel and i was amazed by what he was for anyone who was willing to learn. I started watching one of his youtube playlist called "Career Convos" and there was a video called "Masters or Not" where he was talking about whether a masters degree was necessary for a developer or not and it really helped me understand the current scenario in the tech field where no one cared about the number of degrees you have. In that video he mentioned about a program called ROC8 careers which basically said show me your web-dev skills and i will get you a job.
        </p>

        <p>
            Then i found another program called neog camp where he was training anyone who was willing to learn web development and getting them jobs. I was really amazed by the effort this person was putting in to change another persons life and while watching his videos all i could think was that here is a person who has created a coding community created a program to teach anyone who was ready to learn and also helps, get them jobs, now what more excuses did i have to not start. From there i started learning web development from neogcamp level 0 and freecodecamp.
